VMware Infrastructure Architecture
Overview
This repository presents a structured VMware infrastructure architecture designed to simulate enterprise data center patterns in a lab environment. The design focuses on clear network segmentation, logical topology, and a stable foundation for infrastructure operations and automation testing.

Goal
Provide a realistic infrastructure architecture that supports platform operations, workload deployment scenarios, and future automation workflows.

Design Highlights
Physical multi host setup using Dell PowerEdge servers Layer 3 switching with VLAN based segmentation Dedicated networks for management, storage, and workloads Structured logical topology aligned with enterprise practices Foundation prepared for infrastructure automation

Network Segmentation
Management network for core services such as vCenter and DNS Isolated storage and vMotion networks for host traffic Dedicated VM network for workload environments Separate DevOps tools network for automation services

Core Services
Centralized management through vCenter Firewall and routing provided by OPNsense Identity and DNS services through Active Directory

Purpose
Serve as a reference architecture for building and testing infrastructure operations in a controlled lab environment while maintaining realistic design principles.

Scope
Architecture documentation only No production workloads Designed for learning and platform experimentation

Summary
This architecture establishes a segmented and structured VMware platform that mirrors real world infrastructure design patterns and provides a solid base for future automation and operational testing.
